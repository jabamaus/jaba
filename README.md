# jaba

TODO:

- Add check for calling undefined attributes
- Look again at if generator block should be called per node
- check whether keyvalue attr is really what we want
- Make all nodes readonly once definitions processed
- make paths in jaba.output.json relative to itself
- test absolute root paths
- Look at error handling again
- Change to using caller_location
- Have a way of globally setting default for :platforms, :hosts and :configs (and for clearing)
- consider moving JabaError into Object refinement
- make file/dir attrs cleanpath
- move keyval and reference attr types into core
- beef up specification of keyval options
- introduce TopLevelDefinition?
- test subtypes, eg opening
- add flag that controls whether an attribute is exposed to referent
