# jaba

TODO:

- Look again at if generator block should be called per node
- Make all nodes readonly once definitions processed
- make paths in jaba.output.json relative to itself
- test absolute root paths
- Have a way of globally setting default for :platforms, :hosts and :configs (and for clearing)
- make file/dir attrs cleanpath
- beef up specification of keyval options
- introduce TopLevelDefinition?
- test subtypes, eg opening
- add id as a read only attr to all types
