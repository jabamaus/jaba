<p><a id="WhatGenerators"></a></p>
<h4 id="what-generators-does-jaba-currently-support">What generators does jaba currently support?</h4>
<p>Currently only Visual Studio (win32/x64) but there are plans to support Xcode (ios/osx) and Ninja (linux).</p>
<p><a id="SupportMake"></a></p>
<h4 id="is-jaba-going-to-support-make">Is jaba going to support make?</h4>
<p>No. As far as I am concerned there is no need now that we have Ninja.</p>
<p><a id="WhyRuby"></a></p>
<h4 id="why-is-jaba-written-in-ruby">Why is Jaba written in ruby?</h4>
<p><a id="HowMuchRuby"></a></p>
<h4 id="how-much-ruby-knowledge-do-i-need">How much ruby knowledge do I need?</h4>
<p>Hardly any. See <a href="jaba_ruby_knowledge.html">Ruby knowledge</a>.</p>
<p><a id="WhyNotAutomatic"></a></p>
<h4 id="why-doesnt-jaba-update-the-build-automatically-when-jaba-files-change-why-do-i-have-to-run-jaba-manually-when-i-change-the-build">Why doesn't jaba update the build automatically when .jaba files change? Why do I have to run jaba manually when I change the build?</h4>
<p>This one requires some discussion but there are three main reasons:</p>
<p><a id="ShouldCheckin"></a></p>
<h4 id="should-buildsystem-files-eg-visual-studioxcode-projectsninja-files-etc-be-checked-into-source-control">Should buildsystem files (eg Visual Studio/Xcode projects/ninja files etc) be checked into source control?</h4>
<p>Its up to you. Jaba is designed to allow you to do this and does not place any absolute paths in generated build files. There are good reasons for doing this on some occasions. Firstly you know that the codebase will build out of the box without any build generation system required (if continuous integration is properly used). Secondly, and very importantly, you can see what is going on in the build via source control diffs. This is a fantastically useful tool to see what's going on and demystify things, especially when things go wrong. This is a strong case for checking in at least a few build files. I always do this and its served me well. Of course if you are targeting a lot of platforms and you are in an environment where every developer does it their own way this may be less desirable.</p>

<h4 id="does-jaba-put-absolute-file-paths-in-generated-files">Does jaba put absolute file paths in generated files?</h4>
<p>Absolutely not :) All paths are relative.</p>
