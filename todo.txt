core
- versioning support
- Employ did you mean style error reporting
  Error at basic_dll.jaba:8: 'defines' attribute not defined. Did you mean 'define'?
- Add sticky/transient concept to flag and value options
- Validation and documentation specification for method args, similar to attribute options
- Make _ID be id of the definition the code is in, such that it works even inside a block that is being executed in the context of a different jaba object
- localise error strings into a single file, using macros for variable substitution. As well as being better for standardisation could support multiple languages.
- Implement element deletion for hash attribute
- Disallow ruby keywords as attr names, eg 'in' fails
- make logging and error functionality into Context class methods so they are always available.
- prefix/postfix/delete/exclude should be specced with attr_option. exclude should get its type from its owning attr.
- Remove node_option flag and handle node options same as attribute options
- Add a general :nowarn option. This could replace the :force option. And have a command line switch to force showing of warningss
- Test compound attr with value options
- Add way of retrieving options in jdl:
  src ".", vpath: "generated"
  vpath = src getopt: :vpath
- change shared blocks to use :block attrs rather than custom code
- Check for commonality in pull_up and add test
- Chekc that pull_up works with compounds

path attrs/src
- Support **.h as alternative to **/*.h
- :no_wildcard flag to disallow wildcards
- wildcard validation
- Validate paths for missing / eg '../..debase-ruby_core_source/
- vpath support. Macros would make it more powerful.
- flag to control whether absolute paths allowed in file/dir attrs. Eg build_root_offset is not an offset if absolute path used.
  Is it even a path attr?
- Review whether '.' is allowed in :basename type. Maybe Introduce and allow_ext option.
- enforce that paths stay within their base dir spec?
- exclude from build should be an :info option on src attr

workspace
- Automatically pull in dependencies in
- categories
- add slnproperty which can address sln sections. Particularly useful when used with ExtensibilityGlobals

target
- Make custom build rule support multiple outputs. Requires adding array subscript support to macros.
- Make shell build events use macros
- Add 'install' to copy exes somewhere post build
- Allow 'axes' of configs? Bear in mind that platforms can be any string.

VisualC
- support for debugger working directory via .user file
- Is ToolsVersion='16.0' needed?

test
- vpath
- Regression tests for generated files.
- option in tests to log to stdout
- reorg tests into core folder and target folder?
- bring attr_hash tests back

possible features
- Ability to reverse engineer jaba definitions from existing vsprojects
- Command line option to print full exception info
- Have a command line switch to make all error messages contain absolute paths
- Add invocations.txt to each example which can execute in multiple ways?
- Ability to 'grab' functionality that auto-adds abilities, eg text file
- Auto-delete non-generated files in buildsystem dir (cruft removal)
- Support arrays in hash values? That would allow src attr to work as a value as well as a key.

docs
- tag attrs as control flow attrs somehow for benefit of docs
- ruby license requirements
- Stats in docs, eg number of files in jaba release, size of zip.
- Add node option attrs
- Add attribute options
- common attrs
- methods

jaba tool
- add --list-globals option
- Implement jaba build command to build vs solution
- clean command
