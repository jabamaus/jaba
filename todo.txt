- Put version number into every type and force it to be set in instance.
- Add invocations.txt to each example which cam execute in multiple ways
- Ability to 'grab' a text plugin that auto-adds ability to generate a text file to cpp projects.
- Validate paths for missing / eg '../..debase-ruby_core_source/
- option in tests to log to stdout
- localise error strings into a single file, using macros for variable substitution. As well as being better for standardisation could support multiple languages.
- Support vcfprop at project level too
- Review whether '.' is allowed in :basename type. Maybe Introduce and allow_ext option.
- Introduce :extension type. Use for src_ext
- Regression tests for generated files.
- enforce that paths stay within their base dir spec?
- Implement element deletion for hash attribute
- Add 'install' to copy exes somewhere post build
- Stats in docs, eg number of files in jaba release, size of zip.
- should string attr be allowed to be set to nil? Probably not.
- make jaba clean clean the generated src, the .vs folder, the 'build' folder and optionally the 'buildsystem' folder.
- Disallow ruby keywords as attr names, eg 'in' fails
- Consider making all attributes require a type
- reorg tests into core folder and cpp folder
- Stronger spec for value_options. Need to flag as array.
- add --list-globals option
- Implement jaba build command to build vs solution
- Categories in solution files.
- flag to control whether absolute paths allowed in file/dir attrs. Eg build_root_offset is not an offset if absolute path used.
  Is it even a path attr?
- ability to have build tree out of src but projects in src? config option to base projdir off src_root instead of dest_root?
- Make defaults work per-file. Introduce global_defaults. Or a scope option to defaults.
- Automatically pull in dependencies into workspace
- RUBY LICENSE REQUIREMENTS
- validate when --src-root can be specified. Should be required if no .jaba files in cwd and disallowed if there are.
- Employ did you mean style error reporting
  Error at basic_dll.jaba:8: 'defines' attribute not defined. Did you mean 'define'?
- tag attrs as control flow attrs somehow for benefit of docs
- add slnproperty which can address sln sections. Particularly useful when used with ExtensibilityGlobals
- disband VSProj in favour of VSUtilities module
- Have a command line switch to make all error messages contain absolute paths
- Revisit set_to_default and wipe. Have way of clearing to default and clearing fully, but don't count that as set=true
- Allow 'axes' of configs. Bear in mind that platforms can be any string.
- Make _ID be id of the definition the code is in, such that it works even inside a block that is being executed in the context of a different jaba object
- Ability to reverse engineer jaba definitions from existing vsprojects
- Add 'underlying type' to attribute types? eg file.dir/src_spec are strings. Use this for extra validation and also to sort using casecmp
- resolve issues around sorting with mixed type elements
- Add wildcard validation to dir property
- workspace categories
- Support **.h as alternative to **/*.h?
- Make shell build events use macros
- Is ToolsVersion='16.0' needed?
- support for debugger working directory via .user file
- Bring back boolean reader, eg if debug?
- Add title/example/notes to flag and value option definitions
- move attribute type out of jdl_builder
- Ability to define attrs directly in jaba files maybe in 'extend' section.
- Validation and documentation specification for method args, similar to attribute options

Rewrite simplifications:
- ditched generic type system
- ditched generic referencing system
- ditched property system
- ditched json file
- ditched dry-run
- ditched plugin system
- string/symbol/symbol_or_string combined into just string

New features:
 - rebased onto mruby
 - src files calculated immediately
 - ninja support
 - emscripten support
 - fastbuild support
 - pull dependencies into solution automatically
 - per file defaults
 - delete stale projects in build system
 - ability to set src per config instead of per-project
 - ability to set project type per config instead of per-project
 - rethought transitive properties of dependencies
