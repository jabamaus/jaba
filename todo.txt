- Sort out jdl_glob
- Sort out policy on arguments in api classes
- Allow plugins to have default id
- Make cpp_project and cpp_platform into contained types
- Change to make all modules manually included. eg 'include 'cpp''. Get rid of 'grab'.
- Combine :symbol, :string and :symbol_or_string? Allow strings and symbols to be completely interchangeable?
- Stop globals from having dependencies, reference attrs and compound attrs.
- compound attr should not need a title. Could use the title of the jaba type.
- Add test demonstrating plugins creating dependent objects as they are being processed, eg cpp plugin creates workspaces
- Should be able to map property value in pre_property_set
- I don't like pre/post property set much. Make it specific to each attr not called for every attr.
- Disallow types being used as a compound attr from being flagged as singleton
- Rather than attr :a, type: :compound, jaba_type: :type_with_plugin it could be
  attr :a, embed: type_with_plugin
- I wonder whether the role of build_output could be done by a plugin using process_definition
- Doxygen and manifest files are good plugin examples
- Put version number into every type and force it to be set in instance.
- Consider storing whole callstack and then introducing JabaObject#error method.
- Move block arg number checking into eval_jdl?
- Add invocations.txt to each example which cam execute in multiple ways
- Ability to 'grab' a text plugin that auto-adds ability to generate a text file to cpp projects.
- Validate paths for missing / eg '../..debase-ruby_core_source/
- option in tests to log to stdout
- Add text_plugin.rb to examples in docs
- Moving text into plugin has raised question about host. Need to set requied cpp_project_classname to ''. Not clean.
- Should | be allowed in ids? Probably not.
- Check error reporting in the case that there is an argument error inside Services#define. Needs to present internal callstack.
- not sure about using inspect_unquoted everywhere in error msgs to explicitly show symbols...
- localise error strings into a single file, using macros for variable substitution. As well as being better for standardisation could support multiple languages.
- jaba attr types could register option into JabaAttributeDefinition. noderef/compound types could use it.
- remove text plugin. Or even better turn into a compound attr and add to cpp.
- consider making all paths relative to jaba file when in defaults and shared definitions
- optimise copying of value options once they are more locked down.
- move JabaAttributeType base class into extend folder
- Have a look at RubyVM to try and precompile ruby
- Should :definition_root basedir_spec be able to take its value from the setting attr? Eg if globals attr specifies a definition root base spec it be relative to the user definition.
- Could be moving towards concept of a type requiring configuration
- Support vcfprop at project level too
- Review whether '.' is allowed in :basename type. Maybe Introduce and allow_ext option.
- Introduce :extension type. Use for src_ext
- rename windows_x86 to win_86?
- Standardise 'expected/available' error msg, eg Available: [a|b|c|]
- Regression tests for generated files!
- consider putting .jaba inside buildsystem
- Make build_output use an API so it can check that paths are absolute
- Not sure about build_root now. Is there one root too many? buildsystem_root and artefact can be set relative to jaba file in definitions or if runnning with jaba -B, that could set the buildsystem_root. 
- wrap -D target_host vs2019 into a command line switch
- sort out input system
- enforce that paths stay within their base dir spec
- Implement element deletion for hash attribute
- auto document plugin API
- Add a file copy feature (install?). Could use custom build rule.
- Stats in docs, eg number of files in jaba release, size of zip.
- Finish off input manager cmd work
- Disallow nested src_roots 
- should string attr be allowed to be set to nil? Probably not.
- Add a 'referenced by' doc item for types.
- make jaba clean clean the generated src, the .vs folder, the 'build' folder and optionally the 'buildsystem' folder.
- Disallow ruby keywords as attr names, eg 'in' fails
- Consider making all attributes require a type
- Bed down value option type - eg call validators, testing
- reorg tests into core folder and cpp folder
- Stronger spec for value_options. Need to flag as array.
- Overhaul workspace project glob matching
- add cmd line test for
  - symbol attr
  - node ref attr
  - symbol or string attr
- add --list-globals option
- rename items to choices
* Implement jaba build command to build vs2019 solution
* Categories in solution files.
- flag to control whether absolute paths allowed in file/dir attrs. Eg build_root_offset is not an offset if absolute path used.
  Is it even a path attr?
- ability to have build tree out of src but projects in src? config option to base projdir off src_root instead of dest_root?
- Make defaults work per-file. Introduce global_defaults. Or a scope option to defaults.
* Automatically pull in dependencies into workspace
- attr def properties should have help string/notes...
- Allow default values to take options?
- RUBY LICENSE REQUIREMENTS
- consider having a globals per-type (eg cpp globals)
- validate when --src-root can be specified. Should be required if no .jaba files in cwd and disallowed if there are.
- Check attribute validators when parsing cmd line.
- Employ did you mean style error reporting
  Error at basic_dll.jaba:8: 'defines' attribute not defined. Did you mean 'define'?
- tag attrs as control flow attrs somehow for benefit of docs
- add slnproperty which can address sln sections. Particularly useful when used with ExtensibilityGlobals
- disband VSProj in favour of VSUtilities module
- Move title/note/example into module and include
- Have a command line switch to make all error messages contain absolute paths
- support for 'overriding' attribute defs when opening types, including calling super
- Make :nocheckexists do something
- test :required flag compatibility
- Revisit set_to_default and wipe. Have way of clearing to default and clearing fully, but don't count that as set=true
- In defaults block are paths relative to the defaults file or the file of the definition being instanced?
- Allow 'axes' of configs. Bear in mind that platforms can be any string.
- Have some kind of spec for flag_options, eg

flag_option :export do
  note 'do exporting'
  compatibility do
    'only works on array and hash' if !array? && !hash?
    end
  end
end

- Having two arrays that reference the same type causes problems with :expose. Need to resolve this.
Need to make it so that don't expose if attribute is not single value. Also need to prevent exposing
if there are multiple attrs, with a warning.

  attr_array :valid_archs, type: :ref do
    note 'List of architectures supported by this platform'
    node_type :arch
    flags :required, :no_sort
  end

  attr_array :default_archs, type: :ref do
    note 'List of default target architectures for this platform'
    node_type :arch
    flags :required, :no_sort
  end

- check for duplicate filenames at plugin level, with proper error reporting
- Make _ID be id of the definition the code is in, such that it works even inside a block that is being executed in the context of a different jaba object
- Ability to reverse engineer jaba definitions from existing vsprojects
- Add check for re-entrancy when evaluating default blocks
- consistent method names across tests and consistent brackets on must_equal
- Create a table of attr mappings from jaba->premake->cmake
- Bring back boolean reader, eg if debug?
- Add 'underlying type' to attribute types? eg file.dir/src_spec are strings. Use this for extra validation and also to sort using casecmp
- resolve issues around sorting with mixed type elements
- Add wildcard validation to dir property
- workspace categories
- Allow debug?
- Support **.h as alternative to **/*.h?
- Make shell build events use macros
- add grab bag to reference docs
- Is ToolsVersion='16.0' needed?
- support for debugger working directory via .user file
- directive to only register shared modules when a file included
- Make passing args to shared definitions require keyword args


JABA RETHINK
- app and lib are built in top level type.
- root is a buit in concept
- single level (eg no config no project blocks)
- no direct reading. Use macros.
